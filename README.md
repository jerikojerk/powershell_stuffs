this repository is here to share scripts i can publish.

## test-domain.ps1 
it is a basic tool to perform kind of curl request (powershell fashion) on a list of domain to get the status.

## compare_directories.ps1
it is basic script to check if 2 folders are in sync. maybe we should test what happend if files are not same size.
